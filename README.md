Moving Day is an application that helps users to look for a place to live. I've moved countries a couple of times and everytime I do, I dread looking for a new place. I want to offer others a simple tool that filters out spam, notifies them of listings that match their search criteria and most importantly, gives them peace of mind during stressful times.
